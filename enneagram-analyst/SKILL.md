description: Lemon Studios Story Editor uses this when analyzing optioned IP, incoming scripts, or books in adaptation to evaluate character psychology and arc potential. Use during IP coverage to assess whether a protagonist has a compelling arc for Latin American audiences, or when diagnosing why a character in development is not working. Triggers on: analyze this screenplay, type these characters, diagnose this character, extract the Enneagram from this script, or evaluate character psychology of optioned material.

# Enneagram Analyst

Analyze screenplays to identify character Enneagram types and assess arc alignment.

## Core Methodology

This skill uses Jeff Lyons' Rapid Story Development framework combined with the Enneagram Institute's Levels of Development to provide:
1. **Type identification** based on core fears, desires, and behavioral patterns
2. **Level assessment** to pinpoint where characters sit psychologically
3. **Arc trajectory analysis** showing current path and alignment recommendations
4. **Relationship dynamics** mapping how characters serve story functions

## Analysis Workflow

### Step 1: Initial Read and Character Inventory

List all significant characters. For each, note:
- Key decisions they make (reveals motivation)
- How they respond under pressure (reveals center and type)
- What they avoid or pursue obsessively (reveals fear/desire)
- How they treat others (reveals survival strategy)

### Step 2: Type Identification

For each major character, determine:

**A. Emotional Center**
- Head (5, 6, 7): Anxiety-driven, mental processing, "what if" orientation
- Heart (2, 3, 4): Shame-driven, image/identity focus, "how am I perceived" orientation  
- Body (8, 9, 1): Anger-driven, action/control focus, "what should be done" orientation

**B. Core Pattern**
Cross-reference character behavior against type profiles in `references/type-profiles.md`:
- What do they fear most? (Core Fear)
- What do they pursue most? (Core Desire)
- How do they protect themselves? (Survival Strategy)
- What can't they see about themselves? (Blind Spot)

**C. Wing Assessment**
Identify which adjacent type flavors their behavior:
- Does the character lean toward one wing consistently?
- Do they shift wings in different contexts?

### Step 3: Level Assessment

Using `references/levels-of-development.md`, identify:

**Current Operating Level**
- Where does the character spend most of their screen time?
- Characters often fluctuate 1-2 levels depending on context

**Level Indicators**
- Levels 1-3 (Healthy): Self-aware, flexible, capable of genuine connection
- Levels 4-6 (Average): Defensive, driven by fear, using survival strategies
- Levels 7-9 (Unhealthy): Destructive patterns, blind spot fully controlling behavior

### Step 4: Arc Trajectory Analysis

**Current Arc Direction**
- Positive (ascending levels): Moving toward health/integration
- Negative (descending levels): Moving toward dysfunction/disintegration
- Flat: Maintaining level while affecting others
- Tragic: Growth achieved too late or undone

**Key Beats to Identify**
- Inciting Incident: Does it target the character's blind spot?
- Midpoint: Is there an offer to change?
- Doom Moment: Does it hit their type-specific low point?
- Climax: Is there a moment of truth regarding their blind spot?

**Arc Alignment Assessment**
Flag misalignments:
- Doom moment doesn't match type's specific low point
- Transformation happens without confronting blind spot
- Decline behaviors don't match de-evolution point
- Resolution doesn't demonstrate changed behavior

### Step 5: Relationship Dynamics Mapping

Using `references/relationship-dynamics.md`, assess:

**Opponent Analysis**
- Does opponent target protagonist's blind spots, pinches, and distortion filters?
- Is opponent based on protagonist's de-evolution point?
- Does opponent block protagonist's evolution path?

**Ally Analysis**  
- Do allies model the protagonist's evolution point?
- Do allies provide wing resources?
- Are there false allies enabling the blind spot?

**Romantic Relationship Analysis**
- What type dynamics drive the attraction?
- What type dynamics drive the conflict?
- Does the relationship serve the arc?

**Mentor Analysis**
- Does mentor embody what protagonist needs to learn?
- Is mentor a healthy version of protagonist's type or evolution point?

## Output Format

For each analyzed screenplay, provide:

### Character Breakdown (per major character)

```
CHARACTER: [Name]
TYPE: [Number] - [Name] ([Wing])
LEVEL: [Current operating level, 1-9]
CENTER: [Head/Heart/Body]

EVIDENCE:
- Core Fear Observed: [specific scene/behavior]
- Core Desire Observed: [specific scene/behavior]  
- Survival Strategy: [how they protect themselves]
- Blind Spot: [what they can't see]

CURRENT ARC:
- Direction: [Positive/Negative/Flat/Tragic]
- Starting Level: [X] → Ending Level: [Y]
- Key Transformation Moment: [scene/beat]

ARC ALIGNMENT ISSUES:
- [List any misalignments between behavior and type]

RECOMMENDATIONS:
- [Specific adjustments to align arc with type]
```

### Relationship Map

```
PROTAGONIST: [Type]
├── OPPONENT: [Type] - [How they target protagonist]
├── ALLY: [Type] - [What they model/provide]
├── LOVE INTEREST: [Type] - [Dynamic at play]
└── MENTOR: [Type] - [What they teach]

DYNAMICS ASSESSMENT:
- [What's working]
- [What's missing or misaligned]
- [Recommendations for strengthening relationships]
```

### Structural Notes

Broader observations about:
- Whether the moral component is Enneagram-consistent
- Missing character functions (e.g., no one models evolution point)
- Type clustering that creates monotony or opportunity
- Beat-by-beat suggestions for key scenes

## Reference Files

- `references/type-profiles.md` - Complete profiles for all nine types
- `references/levels-of-development.md` - Nine levels for each type with behavioral markers
- `references/relationship-dynamics.md` - Opponent, ally, lover, mentor design patterns

## Integration Notes

This skill provides character psychology analysis. For structural integration:
- Story Grid methodology connects to genre obligations and controlling idea
- Save the Cat connects to beat-by-beat structure

This skill stands alone but complements structural analysis tools.
